= Quarkus - Container Images

include::./attributes.adoc[]

Quarkus provides extensions for building (and pushing) container images. Currently it supports:

- jib
- docker
- s2i

== Container Image extensions

=== JIB

The extension `quarkus-container-image-jib` is powered by https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib[Jib] for performing container builds.
The major benefit of using Jib with Quarkus, is that all dependencies (everything found under target/lib) are cached in a different layer than the actual application making rebuilds extra fast and extra small (when it comes to pushing).
Another important benefit of using this extension is that it provides the ability to create a container image without having to have any dedicated client side tooling (like Docker) or running daemon processes (like the Docker daemon)
when all that is needed is the ability to push to a container image registry.

To use this image extension, you just need to add the following dependency into your project.

[source,xml]
----
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
      <artifactId>quarkus-container-image-jib</artifactId>
    </dependency>
----


=== Docker

The extension `quarkus-container-image-docker` is using the docker binary and the generated Dockerfiles under `src/main/docker` in order to perform docker builds.

To use this image extension, you just need to add the following dependency into your project.

[source,xml]
----
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
      <artifactId>quarkus-container-image-docker</artifactId>
    </dependency>
----

=== S2i

The extension `quarkus-container-image-s2i` is using s2i binary builds in order to perform container builds inside the Openshift cluster.
The idea behind the binary build is that you just upload the the artifact and its dependencies to the cluster and during the build they will be merged to a builder image (defaults to `fabric8/s2i-java`).

The benefit of this approach, is that it can be combined with Openshift's `DeploymentConfig` that makes it easy to rollout changes to the cluster.

To use this image extension, you just need to add the following dependency into your project.

[source,xml]
----
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
      <artifactId>quarkus-container-image-s2i</artifactId>
    </dependency>
----

S2i builds, require creating a `BuildConfig` and two `ImageStream` resources, one of the builder image and one for the output image.
The creation of such objects is being taken care of by the Quarkus kubernetes extension.

== Building

To build a container image for your project, you just need to specify `quarkus.container-image.build=true` either to the `application.properties` or as a system property.

[source, subs=attributes+]
----
mvn clean package -Dquarkus.container-image.build=true
----

Setting the environment variable `QUARKUS_CONTAINER_IMAGE_EXECUTION` to `build` can be used instead of the system propery.

== Pushing

If the execution is set to `push` then after the build, the image will also be pushed to an image registry.
The registry can be specified using `quarkus.container-image.registry` and will default to `docker.io`.


== Customizing

For customizing the extension the following properties are available:
